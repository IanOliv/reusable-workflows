  • This is a `diff` command that compares two files and shows the differences between them.                                                                                             
      • `--git` specifies that the output should be in the unified diff format used by Git.                                                                                              
      • `a/.github/workflows/workflows-gh.yml` and `b/.github/workflows/workflows-gh.yml` are the paths of the two files being compared.                                                 
  • The first file has changes in lines 15 and 16.                                                                                                                                       
      • The line starting with `-` is being removed.                                                                                                                                     
      • The line starting with `+` is being added.                                                                                                                                       
  • The second file has changes in lines 22 to 26.                                                                                                                                       
      • The lines starting with `-` are being removed.                                                                                                                                   
      • The lines starting with `+` are being added.                                                                                                                                     
  • The lines enclosed in `{+ ... +}` are additional lines being added.                                                                                                                  
  • The line `{+ gh copilot explain "'$(git diff  --word-diff )'"+}` is a command that calls `gh copilot explain` with the output of `git diff --word-diff` as an argument.              
  • The command `gh copilot explain` is being used to get an explanation of the changes made in the diff.
